DataStructures-Algorithms_Practice
===

A collection of self-implemented core computer science data structures and 
algorithms.

I use this repository to collect and share my personal, practice 
implementations of a number of basic, core computer science data
structures and algorithms. Read them, love them, use them, or hate them, do 
whatever you like as long as you don't expect them to be perfect or bug-free!

**Todo:**

* Decide if I want to make my linked list singly-linked or doubly-linked. Or
both. But maybe not that.
* Make the binary search tree self-balanced (Red-Black, AVL, etc.).
* Implement collision resolution for the hash table.
* Generalize the binary tree to an n-ary tree, and turn the BTNode/BST
classes into subclasses of these new n-ary classes.
* Generalize trees as graphs, and subclasses trees from graphs similarly to
binary trees/n-ary trees? Not too sure. This may be more work than it's worth.
* Automated test suite.
* Better commenting that includes basic metadata, descriptions, run-time
analysis, etc..
* Improve class visibility scheme and interface definition by perhaps making 
more things protected/private?
* Implement many, many more data structures!
* Implement a lot of algorithms too!
* Probably a lot of other stuff.
