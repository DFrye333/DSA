DataStructures-Algorithms_Practice
===

A collection of self-implemented core computer science data structures and 
algorithms.

I use this repository to collect and share my personal, practice 
implementations of a number of basic, core computer science data
structures and algorithms. Read them, love them, use them, or hate them, do 
whatever you like as long as you don't expect them to be perfect or bug-free!

**Todo:**

* Decide if I want to make my linked list singly-linked or doubly-linked. Or
both. But maybe not that.
* Automated test suite.
* Better commenting.
* Implement many, many more data structures!
* Implement a lot of algorithms too!
* Probably a lot of other stuff.
